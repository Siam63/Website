                Hello world! My name is Siam Rahman, and this is my own personal blog.
                I touch upon several different topics in my life like my interests,
                school experiences and tips and tricks, motivation and much more.
                If you’re interested in ways you can become a better student,
                want to get some background information about me,
                or just want to learn more about some cool summer projects,
                click the “Blog” button at the top of the page to see some things I talk about in my website.
            </p>
        </div>
